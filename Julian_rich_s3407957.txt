Task 3:

I'd like to develop a delivery analytics program that utilises map/positioning 
AWS API.
The goal would be to track my delivery time for a specified time period (day, 
week, month or year/s), how long I spend being idle in a single location
average speed and other analytics that could be interesting concerning time,
distance and long term analytics of the occupation e.g. average time in one position.
Would rely heavily on position/map services and cloud storage.
